## Walmart Data Analysis: End-to-End SQL + Python Project
This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. We utilize Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions. The project is ideal for data analysts looking to develop skills in data manipulation, SQL querying, and data pipeline creation.

## Download Walmart Sales Data
#Data Source: Use the Kaggle API to download the Walmart sales datasets from Kaggle.

Storage: Save the data in the data/ folder for easy reference and access.
##  Install Required Libraries and Load Data
Libraries: Install necessary Python libraries using:
pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python psycopg2
Loading Data: Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame for initial analysis and transformations.
##  Explore the Data
Goal: Conduct an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.
Analysis: Use functions like .info(), .describe(), and .head() to get a quick overview of the data structure and statistics.
## Data Cleaning
Remove Duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
Handle Missing Values: Drop rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant; fill values where essential.
Fix Data Types: Ensure all columns have consistent data types (e.g., dates as datetime, prices as float).
Currency Formatting: Use .replace() to handle and format currency values for analysis.
Validation: Check for any remaining inconsistencies and verify the cleaned data.
##  Feature Engineering
Create New Columns: Calculate the Total Amount for each transaction by multiplying unit_price by quantity and adding this as a new column.
Enhance Dataset: Adding this calculated field will streamline further SQL analysis and aggregation tasks.
##  Load Data into MySQL and PostgreSQL
Set Up Connections: Connect to MySQL and PostgreSQL using sqlalchemy and load the cleaned data into each database.
Table Creation: Set up tables in both MySQL and PostgreSQL using Python SQLAlchemy to automate table creation and data insertion.
Verification: Run initial SQL queries to confirm that the data has been loaded accurately.
##  SQL Analysis: Complex Queries and Business Problem Solving
Business Problem-Solving: Write and execute complex SQL queries to answer critical business questions, such as:
Revenue trends across branches and categories.
Identifying best-selling product categories.
Sales performance by time, city, and payment method.
Analyzing peak sales periods and customer buying patterns.
Profit margin analysis by branch and category.
Documentation: Keep clear notes of each query's objective, approach, and results.
## . Project Publishing and Documentation
Documentation: Maintain well-structured documentation of the entire process in Markdown or a Jupyter Notebook.
Project Publishing: Publish the completed project on GitHub or any other version control platform, including:
The README.md file (this document).
Jupyter Notebooks (if applicable).
SQL query scripts.
Data files (if possible) or steps to access them.
